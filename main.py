print(TextBox("It was important to have a firm foundation with ancient Egypt’s hot and dry climate since the foundations need to be sturdy enough to withstand the hot desert sun. To achieve this, they used the sun to their advantage; they laid a bed of rocks or bricks at the base of the foundation and the mixture of sand, clay, and water in the hot sun, created the perfect foundation. The result was beautifully crafted ancient Egyptian houses that lasted for centuries. Not everything was perfect in ancient Egypt. Although they had perfect foundations, they didn’t have perfect plans. In fact, they usually didn’t even have any plans for cities and towns. Houses were just built willy-nilly, and the towns were often disorganized. Ancient Egyptian homes were very minimal. This probably had something to do with the hot Egyptian sun. It was important to keep houses open. So, ancient Egyptian’s had only a few windows and had thick walls to help them stay cool. Inside, the houses had a bunch of small rooms, each of which had its own specific purpose like sleeping or cooking. Even though they weren't super fancy, they were organized and concise. The Egyptian sun has a lot to do with ma‘at. Many ancient Egyptian buildings were often faced to the rising sun in the east. For example, temples were often built with their main entrances facing the east, and many tombs were also oriented in this direction. The Great Pyramid was made of more than two million blocks. The Egyptians had thousands of people working together, hauling the stones into place. They also had many people to cook food for all those workers. After working in harmony together for hundreds of years the ancient Egyptians made beautiful symmetrical pyramids. Hieroglyphs were much more than simple scratches in clay to the ancient Egyptians. These symbols had a deep, magical meaning and were 'words of god.' The word 'hieroglyphs' itself translates to 'sacred carvings,'. To the ancient Egyptians, hieroglyphs was a way to communicate with the divine and record their events and history. The only way to determine the reading direction of hieroglyphs is by looking at the direction of the faces. In general, hieroglyphs were read from left to right, starting with the figures facing towards the reader. Even though hieroglyphs did not have punctuation, they were neatly organized in such a pristine way. Scribes wrote carefully recorded details. They were responsible for writing personal letters, recording government laws, and even writing magic spells. Scribes were also precise in performing calculations and keeping records. They could determine the number of bricks needed to construct a wall, as well as the amount of food, such as loaves of bread, required to feed the workers. Scribes were also responsible for recording important events, such as births and deaths. They were known for their attention to detail and ability to organize information clearly and accurately.
